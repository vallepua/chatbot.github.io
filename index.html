    <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
    <p>In recent years, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has led to the development of intelligent virtual assistant that can significantly improve user experience and productivity. 
        One such application is the desktop chatbot assistant, which leverages AI to provide users with personalized assistance and support on their desktop computers.
        The desktop chatbot assistant is designed to understand natural language queries and commands, allowing users to interact with their computers in a more efficient way. By harnessing the power of natural language process(NLP) and machine learning(ML) , the chatbot can analyze user inputs, retrieve relevant information, perform tasks and even engage in conversation with users.
        This proposed project aims to explore the capabilities of AI- power chatbot assistant on desktop platforms and demonstrate how they can enhance user productivity and streamline everyday tasks.
        The chatbot will be designed to be user-friendly and adaptable, catering to the individual needs and preferences of each user. Through this project we hope to showcase the potential of AI in revolutionizing desktop computing and improving the overall user experience.
